        fmt.Printf("got error: %v", err)

# FAQ
#### Why the context.Background() for ?

basically, the context package provide a union method to cancel a request,
whether a user cancel a request explicitly or you set a timeline, and the
request exceed the timeline etc, the resource that associated with that
canceled request will be released immediatelyï¼Œso you have more control
over your request. for more infomation: check [context](https://golang.org/pkg/context/)

#### How do i get the token ?

the wunderlist api support a simple oauth2 service, so you can register
your app at [https://developer.wunderlist.com](https://developer.wunderlist.com/),
then get the token use a oatuh2 library, or by hand :) .

#### why another wunderlist api for go ?

first, i just wanna collect all my todo data, so i write a simple get
request to retrieve all my todo data, but as time goes by, the simple get
request grow bigger and bigger cause i need more detaild about my data, such
as my file, my note, my reminder, so one day, i decide to write a full
fuctional wunderlist api client.
